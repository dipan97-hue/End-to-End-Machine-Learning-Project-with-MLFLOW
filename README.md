# End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Project-with-MLFLOW

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow using MLFLOW. It covers data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model versioning and tracking with MLFLOW
- Model deployment

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Project-with-MLFLOW.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Project-with-MLFLOW
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the data preprocessing script:
    ```sh
    python preprocess.py
    ```
2. Train the model:
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```
3. Tune hyperparameters:
    ```sh
    python tune.py
    ```
4. Deploy the model:
    ```sh
    python deploy.py
    ```
